## Approach

1. As `generators` work the same way as `iterators`, so I went ahead with the approach of solving the problem with the use of `iterators`.

2. Also, because the problem needed a `PseudoGenerator` so I thought, why not make a `class` that will have a `next` method attached to it.

3. After that, I wrote `tests` for the `sequencer` functions and for the sequence generated by `pseudoGenerator`.

4. Then, went ahead and wrote the **implementation** details of `sequencer` functions.

5. Made it `modular` so as to enhance readability as well as to make the testing process easier.

6. As you can see below (in [index.js](https://github.com/iamoperand/advanced-js-test/blob/master/src/part-1/index.js)),


```javascript
const rangeSeqGenerator = generator(rangeSeq(1, 2));
```


  > I called the **function there and then**.

  > Whereas the problem-specification demanded to just provide the function body, and not call it.

  >   I thought that this will be something more **intuitive**, so went ahead and did it this way.

7. Finally I integrated everything and made sure that the tests pass :)
